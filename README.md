The goal of the Stacks framework is to _help you_ create & maintain UIs _(pages & components)_ & function _(composables & APIs)_ libraries. The Stacks build system automatically builds highly-composable & scalable, framework-agnostic libraries‚Äîin beginner & expert-friendly ways, embodying [Composability-First Design](/apps/site/docs/composability-first-design.md) principles.

![Atomic UI & FX Design](./apps/site/images/diagram.png)

ü§ñ **Zero-config, by design**

The Stacks framework automagically bundles & builds your code. A Web Component library, Vue 2 & 3 libraries, a composable functions library or API, plus all of its relating type declarations. Out of plain HTML & minimal JavaScript. _The best of the Vite & Nitro engines in a zero-config way._

üé® **Style with ease**

Create your own style guide using conventions you are familiar with. Stacks' UnoCSS atomic engine allows for just that, in a blazing-fast, on-demand way. Tailwind CSS, Windi CSS, Bootstrap, Tachyons, Heroicons, Material Design Icons, and more to choose from.

**‚ú® Next-gen Developer Experience _(DX)_**

Whether it is the simplistic artisan setup & maintenance, the toolkit of accessible APIs, modern git commit conventions, a powerful, yet simple, CI, automated npm package releases & semver versioning, pretty changelog generations, automated PR dependency updates, built-in spell-checking, integrated documentation tooling, or the pre-configured examples... _Stacks has it all._

üí° **First-class VS Code integration**

IDE Capabilities, such as type hints, code completion, code formatting, and more‚Äîall natively built-into Stacks. _And without the need of Prettier._

üßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Extremely beginner & expert-friendly**

No matter whether you are a beginner or an expert, the approachable Stacks design allows you to learn at your own pace, using our thorough documentation covering every aspect of the framework.

Develop beautiful, reactive, composable UIs & functions without learning a new set of languages. HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript‚Äîthat's all you need to dive in now! _(Or TypeScript ‚úåüèº)_

> _The clever way to build & share component & function libraries (and servers!)._

## Get Started

It's incredibly easy to get started with this framework. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx artisan-init my-project

# alternatively, if unsure about your Node/pnpm setup, run:
curl -fsSL https://stacksjs.dev/setup | bash
```

> **Note**
> Node.js v18.10 or higher required. _Artisan will set you up._

## ü§ñ Usage

The following list is of some of the most common ways to interact with the Stacks API. Meet the Artisan Toolkit:

```bash
pnpm artisan install # installs all dependencies
pnpm artisan dev # starts one of the dev servers (components, functions, pages, or docs)
pnpm artisan build # follow CLI prompts to select which library (or server) to build
pnpm artisan commit # follow CLI prompts for committing changes
pnpm artisan release # creates the releases for the stack & consequently, publishes them to npm

pnpm artisan make:component HelloWorld # bootstraps a HelloWorld component
pnpm artisan make:function HelloWorld # bootstraps a HelloWorld function
pnpm artisan make:page hello-world # bootstraps a HelloWorld page (https://127.0.0.1/hello-world)

pnpm artisan help
```

<details>
<summary>View the complete Stacks Artisan Toolkit</summary>

```bash
pnpm artisan install # or `pnpm i`
pnpm artisan fresh # fresh reinstall of all deps

pnpm artisan dev # starts one of the dev servers (components, functions, pages, or docs)
pnpm artisan dev:components # starts local playground dev server
pnpm artisan dev:pages # starts local pages dev server
pnpm artisan dev:docs # starts local docs dev server

pnpm artisan make:component HelloWorld
pnpm artisan make:function hello-world
pnpm artisan make:page hello-world
pnpm artisan make:lang en
pnpm artisan make:stack hello-world

pnpm artisan stub # stubs all the libraries
pnpm artisan stub:components # stubs the component library
pnpm artisan stub:functions # stubs the function library
pnpm artisan stub:pages # stubs the pages

pnpm artisan lint # runs linter
pnpm artisan lint:fix # runs linter and fixes issues

pnpm artisan commit # follow CLI prompts for committing staged changes
pnpm artisan release # creates the releases for the stack & triggers the Release Action (workflow)
pnpm artisan changelog # generates CHANGELOG.md

# building for production (e.g. npm)

pnpm artisan build # select a specific build (follow CLI prompts)
pnpm artisan build:components # builds component libraries
pnpm artisan build:functions # builds function library
pnpm artisan build:web-components # builds framework agnostic Web Component library (i.e. Custom Elements)
pnpm artisan build:components # builds Vue 2 & 3 compatible libraries

# when building for Vercel, Netlify, and more

pnpm artisan deploy:docs

# creates a server to be deployed into any VPS

pnpm artisan server:functions # wip
pnpm artisan server:pages # wip

pnpm artisan example # select the example to run (follow CLI prompts)

# test your stack

pnpm artisan test # runs test suite
pnpm artisan test:unit # runs unit tests
pnpm artisan test:e2e # runs e2e tests
pnpm artisan test:coverage # runs test coverage
pnpm artisan test:types # runs typecheck

```

## üìö Utilizing the Built Libraries

Because Stacks optimizes the development of easily reusable & composable component & function libraries, the primary intention is to always _keep it simple, yet configurable._

By default, Stacks realizes whether your Stack includes components, functions, and/or pages. Based on that determination, Stacks builds your outputs.

The UI libraries that automatically get built are: a Web Component (Custom Elements) & Vue Component library.

<details>
<summary>Web Component usage</summary>

```bash
npm install my-awesome-library
```

After you installed your Stacks generated library, you can use a "Custom Element" (Web Component) in the following way:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <hello-world name="Jane Doe"></hello-world>
    <script src="my-awesome-library.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Vue 2 & 3 usage</summary>

```bash
npm install my-awesome-library
```

After you installed your Stacks generated library, you can use your Vue Components in the following way:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import HelloWorld from 'my-awesome-library'
</script>

<template>
  <HelloWorld name="J Doe" />
</template>
```

</details>

_A function library may also be automatically generated._

<details>
<summary>Functions usage</summary>

```bash
npm install hello-world-library
```

After you installed your Stacks generated library, you can use your functions in the following way:

```ts
import { count, increment } from 'hello-world-fx'

console.log('count is', count)

increment()

console.log('increased count is', count)
```

</details>

You may view this framework as an incredibly "useful set of frames" to assist in efficiently bootstrapping, designing, and managing component & function libraries‚Äîusing industry best-practices, to reach one of the broadest user bases possible.
