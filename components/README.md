# Your Component Library

This is the where you create your components.

> **Note**
> If your project does not require any UI components, you can remove this folder. If your library does include components, you may use this readme as the boilerplate of your component library.

## üí° Get Started

It's easy to get started. The only prerequisite is a basic understanding HTML, sprinkled with *minimal* JavaScript. In other words, there is virtually no learning curve.

```bash
# you may use this GitHub template or the following command:
npx artisan make:stack hello-world
cd hello-world-stack

pnpm i # install deps for all packages
pnpm dev # stubs the packages for local use
pnpm dev:vite-vue # starts the dev server
pnpm build # builds the packages for production-ready use
```

Additionally, the `package.json` contains some useful snippets you likely want to be aware of.

## ü§ñ Usage

Because this project is optimized toward the development of easily reusable & composable component libraries, it's very easy to use (and distribute):

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import HelloWorld from 'hello-world-stack'
</script>

<template>
  <HelloWorld name="J Doe" />
</template>
```

### Tips

This project also includes a simple way to handle your versioning. Through semantic commit names, it will also generate the two changelogs: one as part of the GitHub releases & the one markdown file that's stored within the root of the project.

```bash
# how to create a git commit?
git add . # select the changes you want to commit
pnpm run commit # then simply follow the prompts

# after you successfully committed, you may create a "release"
pnpm run release # automates git commits, versioning, and CHANGELOG generation
```
